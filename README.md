# Node Web Development Setup instructions

This setup is adapted from the setup for the [Le Wagon Web Development course](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time).

Please **read them carefully and execute all commands in the following order**.

Take a look at [these cheatsheets](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/tree/master/docs) for common issue fixes and tips :heavy_check_mark:

Let's start :rocket:


## A note about quitting apps on a Mac

Clicking the little red cross in the top left corner of the application window on a Mac **does not really quit it**, it just closes an active window. To quit the application _for real_ either press `Cmd + Q` when the application is active, or navigate to `APP_NAME` -> `Quit` in the menu bar.

During this setup you will be asked to **quit and re-open** applications multiple times, please make sure you do it properly :pray:

## Command Line Tools

Open a new terminal, copy-paste the following command and hit `Enter`:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

If you receive the following message, you can just skip this step and go to next step.

```bash
# command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
```

Otherwise, it will open a window asking you if you want to install some software: click on "Install" and wait.


![Install xcode-select on macOS](images/macos_xcode_select_install.png)

:heavy_check_mark: If you see the message "The software was installed" then all good :+1:

:x: If the command `xcode-select --install` fails try again: sometimes the Apple servers are overloaded.

:x: If you see the message "Xcode is not currently available from the Software Update server", you need to update the software update catalog:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog
```

Once this is done, you can try to install again.


## Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a package manager: it's a software used to install other software from the command line. Let's install it!

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This will ask for your confirmation (hit `Enter`) and your **macOS user account password** (the one you use to [log in](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202860) when you reboot your Macbook).

:warning: When you type your password, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your password as a whole but also its length. Just type your password and when you're done, press `Enter`.

If you already have Homebrew, it will tell you so, that's fine, go on.

Then install some useful software:

```bash
brew update
```

If you get a `/usr/local must be writable` error, just run this:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local
brew update
```

Error message or not, proceed running the following in the terminal (you can copy / paste all the lines at once).

```bash
brew upgrade git || brew install git
brew upgrade gh || brew install gh
brew upgrade wget || brew install wget
brew upgrade imagemagick || brew install imagemagick
brew upgrade jq || brew install jq
brew upgrade openssl || brew install openssl
```


## Visual Studio Code

### Installation

Let's install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) text editor.

Copy (`Cmd` + `C`) the command below then paste it in your terminal (`Cmd` + `V`):

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

Then launch VS Code by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
code
```

:heavy_check_mark: If a VS Code window has just opened, you're good to go :+1:


## VS Code Extensions

### Installation

Let's install some useful extensions to VS Code.

Copy-paste the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
code --install-extension ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings
code --install-extension emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons
code --install-extension github.github-vscode-theme
code --install-extension dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
```

Here is a list of the extensions you are installing:
- [Sublime Text Keymap and Settings Importer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings)
- [VSCode Great Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)



## macOS Terminal Theme

Launch a terminal, click on `Terminal > Preferences` and set the "Pro" theme as default profile.

![Set Pro Theme for macOS terminal](images/macos_terminal_pro.png)

**Quit and restart** your terminal: it should now have a nice black background, easier on the eyes.


## Oh-my-zsh

Let's install the `zsh` plugin [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

In a terminal execute the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

If asked "Do you want to change your default shell to zsh?", press `Y`

At the end your terminal should look like this:

![Ubuntu terminal with OhMyZsh](images/oh_my_zsh.png)

:heavy_check_mark: If it does, you can continue :+1:

:x: Otherwise, please **ask for a teacher**


## GitHub CLI

CLI is the acronym of [Command-line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

In this section, we will use [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to interact with GitHub directly from the terminal.

It should already be installed on your computer from the previous commands.

First in order to **login**, copy-paste the following command in your terminal:

:warning: **DO NOT edit the `email`**

```bash
gh auth login -s 'user:email' -w
```

gh will ask you few questions:

`What is your preferred protocol for Git operations?` With the arrows, choose `SSH` and press `Enter`. SSH is a protocol to log in using SSH keys instead of the well known username/password pair.

`Generate a new SSH key to add to your GitHub account?` Press `Enter` to ask gh to generate the SSH keys for you.

If you already have SSH keys, you will see instead `Upload your SSH public key to your GitHub account?` With the arrows, select your public key file path and press `Enter`.

`Enter a passphrase for your new SSH key (Optional)`. Type something you want and that you'll remember. It's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive. Then press `Enter`.

:warning: When you type your passphrase, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your passphrase as a whole but also its length. Just type your passphrase and when you're done, press `Enter`.

You will then get the following output:

```bash
! First copy your one-time code: 0EF9-D015
- Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Select and copy the code (`0EF9-D015` in the example), then press `Enter`.

Your browser will open and ask you to authorize GitHub CLI to use your GitHub account. Accept and wait a bit.

Come back to the terminal, press `Enter` again, and that's it.

To check that you are properly connected, type:

```bash
gh auth status
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you get `Logged in to github.com as <YOUR USERNAME> `, then all good :+1:

:x: If not, **contact a teacher**.


## Dotfiles (Standard configuration)

It's nice to refine and polish your shell and tools.

Here's a great default configuration provided by Le Wagon: [`lewagon/dotfiles`](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles).

As your configuration is personal, you need your **own** repository storing it. So you will **fork** Le Wagon repository.

Forking means that you will create a new repo in your own GitHub account `$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles`, identical to the original Le Wagon one that you will be able to modify at will.

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=`gh api user | jq -r '.login'`
echo $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

:heavy_check_mark: You should see your GitHub username printed.

:x: If not, **stop here** and ask for help. There may be a problem with the previous step (`gh auth`).

Time to fork the repo and clone it on your computer:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME && cd $_
gh repo fork lewagon/dotfiles --clone
```

### Dotfiles installer

Run the `dotfiles` installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles
zsh install.sh
```

Check the emails registered with your GitHub Account. You'll need to pick one at the next step:

```bash
gh api user/emails | jq -r '.[].email'
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see the list of your registered emails, you can proceed :+1:

:x: If not, please [reauthenticate to GitHub](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/macos.md#github-cli) before running this command :point_up: again.

### git installer

Run the `git` installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh git_setup.sh
```

:point_up: This will **prompt** you for your name (`FirstName LastName`) and your email.

:warning: You **need** to put one of the email listed above thanks to the previous `gh api ...` command. If you don't do that, Kitt won't be able to track your progress.

Please now **reset** your terminal by running:

```bash
exec zsh
```

## Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime to execute JavaScript code in the terminal. Let's install it with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), a version manager for Node.js.

In a terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | zsh
exec zsh
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
nvm -v
```

You should see a version. If not, ask a teacher.

Now let's install node:

```bash
nvm install 16.15.1
```

When the installation is finished, run:

```bash
node -v
```

If you see `v16.13.1`, the installation succeeded :heavy_check_mark: You can then run:

```bash
nvm cache clear
```


## yarn

[`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager to install JavaScript libraries. Let's install it:

In a terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
exec zsh
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
yarn -v
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see a version, you're good :+1:


## SQLite

In a few weeks, we'll talk about databases and SQL. [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) is a database engine used to execute SQL queries on single-file databases. Let's install it:

In a terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
brew install sqlite
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 -version
```

:heavy_check_mark: If you see a version, you're good :+1:


## PostgreSQL

Sometimes, SQLite is not enough and we will need a more advanced tool called [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), an open-source robust and production-ready database system.

Let's install it now.

Run the following commands:

```bash
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

Once you've done that, let's check that it worked:

```bash
psql -d postgres
```

If you enter a new prompt like this one, you're good!

```bash
psql (13.3)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

To quit it, type `\q` then `Enter`.


## macOS settings

### Security

It is mandatory that you protect your session behind a password.If it is not already the case, go to ` > System Preferences > Users & Groups` and change your account password. You should also go to ` > System Preferences > Security > General`. You should require a password `5 seconds` after sleep or screen saver begins.

You can also go to ` > System Preferences > Mission Control` and click on the `Hot Corners` button at the bottom left. Choose for the bottom right corner to start the screen saver. That way, when you leave your desk, you can quickly lock you screen by putting your mouse in the bottom right corner. 5 seconds after, your Macbook will be locked and will ask for a password to get back on the session.

### Keyboard

As you become a programmer, you'll understand that leaving the keyboard takes a lot of time, so you'll want to minimize using the trackpad or the mouse. Here are a few tricks on macOS to help you do that.

#### Keyboard speed

Go to ` > System Preferences > Keyboard`. Set `Key Repeat` to the fastest position (to the right) and `Delay Until Repeat` to the shortest position (to the right).

#### Full Keyboard Access

Go to ` > System Preferences > Keyboard`. Click on the third tab `Shortcuts`. At the bottom of the pane, click the radio button `All controls`. This way when you get a dialog with several options, you'll be able to type `Enter` to confirm, or `SPACE` to choose the cancel option. If you have more than two options, you can use tab to circle between them.

#### macOS For hackers

[Read this script](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) and cherry-pick some stuff you think will suit you. For instance, you can type in the terminal this one:

```bash
# Expanding the save panel by default
defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSNavPanelExpandedStateForSaveMode -bool true
defaults write NSGlobalDomain PMPrintingExpandedStateForPrint -bool true
defaults write NSGlobalDomain PMPrintingExpandedStateForPrint2 -bool true

# Save screenshots to the Desktop (or elsewhere)
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location "${HOME}/Desktop"

# etc..
```


## Setup completed!

Your computer is now all set :muscle: :clap:
